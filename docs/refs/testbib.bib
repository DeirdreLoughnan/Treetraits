abstract = {Abstract Climate change has changed the phenologies of species worldwide, but it remains unclear how these phenological changes will affect species interactions and the structure of natural communities. Using a novel approach to analyse long‐term data of 66 amphibian species pairs across eight communities, we demonstrate that phenological shifts can significantly alter the interaction potential of coexisting competitors. Importantly, these changes in interaction potential were mediated by non‐uniform, species‐specific shifts in entire phenological distributions and consequently could not be captured by metrics traditionally used to quantify phenological shifts. Ultimately, these non‐uniform shifts in phenological distributions increased the interaction potential for 25{\%} of species pairs (and did not reduce interaction potential for any species pair), altering temporal community structure and potentially increasing interspecific competition. These results demonstrate the potential of phenological shifts to reshape temporal structure of natural communities, emphasising the importance of considering entire phenological distributions of natural populations.},

abstract = {Accurate predictions of spring plant phenology with climate change are critical for projec-tions of growing seasons, plant communities and a number of ecosystem services, including carbon storage. Progress towards prediction, however, has been slow because the major cues known to drive phenology – temperature (including winter chilling and spring forcing) and photoperiod – generally covary in nature and may interact, making accurate predictions of plant responses to climate change complex and nonlinear. Alternatively, recent work sug-gests many species may be dominated by one cue, which would make predictions much simpler. Here, we manipulated all three cues across 28 woody species from two North American forests. All species responded to all cues examined. Chilling exerted a strong effect, especially on budburst ({\`{A}}15.8 d), with responses to forcing and photoperiod greatest for leafout ({\`{A}}19.1 and {\`{A}}11.2 d, respectively). Interactions between chilling and forcing suggest that each cue may compensate somewhat for the other. Cues varied across species, leading to staggered leafout within each community and supporting the idea that phenology is a critical aspect of species' temporal niches. Our results suggest that predicting the spring phenology of communities will be difficult, as all species we studied could have complex, nonlinear responses to future warming.},

Functional traits provide insight into a variety of ecological questions, yet the optimal sam- pling method to estimate the community-level distribution of plant functional trait values remains a subject of debate, especially in species-rich forests. 2. We present a simulation analysis of the trait distribution of a set of nine completely sampled permanent plots in the lowland rain forests of French Guiana. 3. Increased sampling intensity consistently improved accuracy in estimating community- weighted means and variances of functional trait values, whereas there was substantial varia- tion among functional traits and minor differences among sampling strategies. 4. Thus, investment in intensified sampling yields a greater improvement in the accuracy of estimation than does an equivalent investment in sampling design complication. 5. Notably, ‘taxon-free' strategies frequently had greater accuracy than did abundance-based strategies, which had the additional cost of requiring botanical surveys. 6. We conclude that there is no substitute for extensive field sampling to accurately character- ize the distribution of functional trait values in species-rich forests.},

abstract = {Observational studies and experimental evidence agree that rising global temperatures have altered plant phenology-the timing of life events, such as flowering, germination, and leaf-out. Other large-scale global environmental changes, such as nitrogen deposition and altered precipitation regimes, have also been linked to changes in flowering times. Despite our increased understanding of how abiotic factors influence plant phenology, we know very little about how biotic interactions can affect flowering times, a significant knowledge gap given ongoing human-caused alteration of biodiversity and plant community structure at the global scale. We experimentally manipulated plant diversity in a California serpentine grassland and found that many plant species flowered earlier in response to reductions in diversity, with peak flowering date advancing an average of 0.6 days per species lost. These changes in phenology were mediated by the effects of plant diversity on soil surface temperature, available soil N, and soil moisture. Peak flowering dates were also more dispersed among species in high-diversity plots than expected based on monocultures. Our findings illustrate that shifts in plant species composition and diversity can alter the timing and distribution of flowering events, and that these changes to phenology are similar in magnitude to effects induced by climate change. Declining diversity could thus contribute to or exacerbate phenological changes attributed to rising global temperatures.},

abstract = {Climate change can influence the abundance of insect herbivores through
direct and indirect mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated multitrophic
drivers of herbivore abundance for an aphid species (Aphis helianthi) in
a subalpine food web consisting of a host plant (Ligusticum porteri),
mutualist ants and predatory lygus bugs (Lygus spp.). We used a
model-selection approach to determine which climate and host plant cues
best predict year-to-year variation in insect phenology and abundance
observed over 6 years. We complemented this observational study with
experiments that determined how elevated temperature interacts with (1)
host plant phenology and (2) the ant-aphid mutualism to determine aphid
abundance. We found date of snowmelt to be the best predictor of yearly
abundance of aphid and lygus bug abundance but the direction of this
effect differed. Aphids achieved lower abundances in early snowmelt
years likely due to increased abundance of lygus bug predators in these
years. Elevating temperature of L. porteri flowering stalks reduced
their quality as hosts for aphid populations. However, warming aphid
colonies on host plants of similar quality increased population growth
rates. Importantly, this effect was apparent even in the absence of
ants. While we observed fewer ants tending colonies at elevated
temperatures, these colonies also had reduced numbers of lygus bug
predators. This suggests that mutualism with ants becomes less
significant as temperature increases, which contrasts other
ant-hemipteran systems. Our observational and experimental results show
the importance of multitrophic species interactions for predicting the
effect of climate change on the abundances of herbivores.},

A phylogenetic supertree was constructed for over 4600 taxa, allowing for comprehensive analyses of divergences across the seed plant phylogeny. Community-wide means and variances for wood densities were quantified for 171 standardized forest communities. Wood density was generally highly conserved across the entire seed plant phylogeny, yet large divergences were found within the rosid clade. Geographic and community variation in wood density, however, was significantly lower in temperate and high elevation communities, dominated by gymnosperms, than in tropical lowland communities, dominated by angiosperms, suggesting an increase in trait and, to some extent, clade filtering with latitude and elevation. Together, our results support the notion that both biotic and abiotic forces have been important in the evolution of wood density as well as in controlling the observed trait mean and variance across geographic gradients.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

We tested this hypothesis using experiments in 215 species and leaf-out monitoring in 1585 species from East Asia (EA), Europe (EU) and North America (NA). The results reveal that species from regions with high STV indeed have higher winter chilling requirements, and, when grown under the same conditions, leaf out later than related species from regions with lower STV. Since 1900, STV has been consistently higher in NA than in EU and EA, and under experimentally short winter conditions NA species required 84{\%} more spring warming for bud break, EU ones 49{\%} and EA ones only 1{\%}.

abstract = {1.Because perennial herbs of temperate climates develop their aboveground parts every year anew, their success critically depends on the timing and speed of this growth (growth phenology). These parameters can play a role in species coexistence and may differ along environmental gradients. Still, we know little about them, as most phenological data come from observations of flowering and to a lesser degree leafing onset. 2.We collected data on growth phenology of about 400 perennial herbs in a botanical garden to make the results independent of local differences in climatic drivers as much as possible. Using these data, we determined species-specific parameters of Day of peak growth, Day of maturity, and two types of growth rates associated with the change in plant size. Environmental conditions in which these species occur in the field were assessed using Ellenberg indicator values, which express species' optima along gradients of moisture, nutrients and temperature. 3.Both timing and speed of growth estimated in the common garden were affected by light and moisture conditions of the habitats where the species typically occur. All parameters showed phylogenetic conservatism. 4.We identified two relationships among these parameters of growth phenology: (i) species with early peak growth had high relative growth rates in contrast to late species; (ii) tall species showed later peak growth than short species. The first relationship is associated with survival under forest canopy, where species are selected to grow early and fast before trees leaf out, which restricts their size. The latter is associated with (asymmetric) competition for light in open habitats, where the main selection factor is for tall stature, which cannot be attained early in the season. 5.Synthesis: We show that large differences in size growth dynamics among herbaceous species are constrained by a few key tradeoffs involving height at maturity, rate of growth, and time when maximum height is attained. These tradeoffs correspond to major selective forces acting on herbaceous plants in temperate climates. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society. Non-native understorey woody species have been shown to extend leaf display and inhabit vacant phenological niches in early spring and late autumn when growing with native counterparts in temperate deciduous forests across the world. Despite the potential competitive advantages, extended leaf duration also subjects non-native species to possible hydraulic risks associated with maintaining leaves during periods of increased frost probability. It remains unclear how non-native species are able to maintain xylem function within this context. Leaf phenology in temperate deciduous trees has been shown to be a function of xylem anatomy, with earlier bud break associated with smaller xylem vessels due to the presumed resistance of smaller vessels to freezing-induced cavitation. We examined relationships between leaf phenology and xylem vessel traits across 82 native and non-native understorey deciduous woody species common to eastern U.S. deciduous forests. We hypothesized that non-native species possess xylem vessel traits associated with maximum hydraulic safety during frost-prone spring and autumn leaf display without compromising rapid growth rate. Larger metaxylem vessels in non-native species were associated with both faster spring growth and delayed autumn leaf fall compared to native species. Non-native species also had smaller latewood vessel diameter, latewood vessel area percentage and a higher proportion of solitary vessels in the entire secondary xylem cross section compared to natives, potentially increasing their resistance to freezing- and/or drought-induced cavitation in autumn, thus allowing for delayed autumn leaf fall. Native and non-native species exhibited similar dates of spring bud break and leaf emergence, consistent with similar xylem vessel size and vessel area percentage within metaxylem and earlywood. Within both groups, species with earlier bud and leaf emergence had a higher total percentage of vessel area within metaxylem and earlywood. This suggests understorey species need sufficient water to support their early spring growth at the risk of freezing-induced cavitation. Our study suggests xylem vessel properties, along with cross-sectional spatial xylem vessel distribution, reflect the capacity of non-native plants to thrive in a new environment and deepen our understanding of the physiological mechanisms of successful invasions of non-native understorey woody plant species.},

abstract = {Differences in phenological responses to climate change among species can desynchronise ecological interactions and thereby threaten ecosystem function. To assess these threats, we must quantify the relative impact of climate change on species at different trophic levels. Here, we apply a Climate Sensitivity Profile approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets, spatially matched to temperature and precipitation data, to quantify variation in climate sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite this variability, we detected systematic variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological climate sensitivity. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower climate sensitivity than other groups. We used mid-century climate change projections to estimate that the timing of phenological events could change more for primary consumers than for species in other trophic levels (6.2 versus 2.5–2.9 days earlier on average), with substantial taxonomic variation (1.1–14.8 days earlier on average).},

abstract = {Shifts in phenology are already resulting in disruptions to the timing of migration and breeding, and asynchronies between interacting species1–5. Recent syntheses have concluded that trophic level 1 , latitude 6 and how phenological responses are measured 7 are key to determining the strength of phenological responses to climate change. However, researchers still lack a comprehensive framework that can predict responses to climate change globally and across diverse taxa. Here, we synthesize hundreds of published time series of animal phenology from across the planet to show that temperature primarily drives phenological responses at mid-latitudes, with precipitation becoming important at lower latitudes, probably reflecting factors that drive seasonality in each region. Phylogeny and body size are associated with the strength of phenological shifts, suggesting emerging asynchronies between interacting species that differ in body size, such as hosts and parasites and predators and prey. Finally, although there are many compelling biological explanations for spring phenological delays, some examples of delays are associated with short annual records that are prone to sampling error. Our findings arm biologists with predictions concerning which climatic variables and organismal traits drive phenological shifts.},

@article{Anderegg2016,
abstract = {Range shifts are among the most ubiquitous ecological responses to anthropogenic climate change and have large consequences for ecosystems. Unfortunately, the ecophysiological forces that constrain range boundaries are poorly understood, making it difficult to mechanistically project range shifts. To explore the physiological mechanisms by which drought stress controls dry range boundaries in trees, we quantified elevational variation in drought tolerance and in drought avoidance-related functional traits of a widespread gymnosperm (ponderosa pine – Pinus ponderosa) and angiosperm (trembling aspen – Populus tremuloides) tree species in the southwestern USA. Specifically, we quantified tree-to-tree variation in growth, water stress (predawn and midday xylem tension), drought avoidance traits (branch conductivity, leaf/needle size, tree height, leaf area-to-sapwood area ratio), and drought tolerance traits (xylem resistance to embolism, hydraulic safety margin, wood density) at the range margins and range center of each species. Although water stress increased and growth declined strongly at lower range margins of both species, ponderosa pine and aspen showed contrasting patterns of clinal trait variation. Trembling aspen increased its drought tolerance at its dry range edge by growing stronger but more carbon dense branch and leaf tissues, implying an increased cost of growth at its range boundary. By contrast, ponderosa pine showed little elevational variation in drought-related traits but avoided drought stress at low elevations by limiting transpiration through stomatal closure, such that its dry range boundary is associated with limited carbon assimilation even in average climatic conditions. Thus, the same climatic factor (drought) may drive range boundaries through different physiological mechanisms – a result that has important implications for process-based modeling approaches to tree biogeography. Further, we show that comparing intraspecific patterns of trait variation across ranges, something rarely done in a range-limit context, helps elucidate a mechanistic understanding of range constraints.},
