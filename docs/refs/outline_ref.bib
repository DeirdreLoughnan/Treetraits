	Abstract = {The onset of the growing season of trees has been earlier by 2.3 days per decade during the last 40 years in temperate Europe because of global warming. The effect of temperature on plant phenology is, however, not linear because temperature has a dual effect on bud development. On one hand, low temperatures are necessary to break bud endodormancy, and, on the other hand, higher temperatures are necessary to promote bud cell growth afterward. Different process-based models have been developed in the last decades to predict the date of budbreak of woody species. They predict that global warming should delay or compromise endodormancy break at the species equatorward range limits leading to a delay or even impossibility to flower or set new leaves. These models are classically parameterized with flowering or budbreak dates only, with no information on the endodormancy break date because this information is very scarce. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of a set of phenological models to accurately predict the endodormancy break dates of three fruit trees. Our results show that models calibrated solely with budbreak dates usually do not accurately predict the endodormancy break date. Providing endodormancy break date for the model parameterization results in much more accurate prediction of this latter, with, however, a higher error than that on budbreak dates. Most importantly, we show that models not calibrated with endodormancy break dates can generate large discrepancies in forecasted budbreak dates when using climate scenarios as compared to models calibrated with endodormancy break dates. This discrepancy increases with mean annual temperature and is therefore the strongest after 2050 in the southernmost regions. Our results claim for the urgent need of massive measurements of endodormancy break dates in forest and fruit trees to yield more robust projections of phenological changes in a near future.},

	Abstract = {Plants are finely tuned to the seasonality of their environment, and shifts in the timing of plant activity (i.e. phenology) provide some of the most compelling evidence that species and ecosystems are being influenced by global environmental change. Researchers across disciplines have observed shifting phenology at multiple scales, including earlier spring flowering in individual plants and an earlier spring green-up' of the land surface revealed in satellite images. Experimental and modeling approaches have sought to identify the mechanisms causing these shifts, as well as to make predictions regarding the consequences. Here, we discuss recent advances in several fields that have enabled scaling between species responses to recent climatic changes and shifts in ecosystem productivity, with implications for global carbon cycling. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {* Premise of the study: Climate change is associated with phenological shifts in an increasing number of organisms worldwide. However, accurate estimates of these shifts are dependent on long-term data sets that include phenological observations from before annual average temperatures began to rise. * Methods: We compared the first flowering times of native prairie plants between 2007 and 2010 with historical data recorded by O. A. Stevens from 1910 to 1961. By merging climate variable data from the same time period, it also was possible to correlate first flowering dates with associated climate variables. * Key results: Over the past 100 years, spring temperatures in the Red River Valley near Fargo, North Dakota, USA, have increased, and growing seasons have lengthened significantly. Seventy-five percent of the 178 species observed by Stevens had flowering times that were sensitive to at least one variable related to temperature or precipitation. Over the past 4 yr, 5{\%} to 17{\%} of the species observed have significantly shifted their first flowering time either earlier or later relative to the previous century. * Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that as spring temperatures in the northern Great Plains have increased and the growing season has lengthened, some spring flowering species have advanced their first flowering time, some fall species have delayed their first flowering, and some species have not changed. Given the importance of flowering timing for reproductive success, the changing climate in the Great Plains is expected to have long-term ecological and evolutionary consequences for native plant species.},

	Abstract = {The average first flowering date of 385 British plant species has advanced by 4.5 days during the past decade compared with the previous four decades: 16{\%} of species flowered significantly earlier in the 1990s than previously, with an average advancement of 15 days in a decade. Ten species (3{\%}) flowered significantly later in the 1990s than previously. These data reveal the strongest biological signal yet of climatic change. Flowering is especially sensitive to the temperature in the previous month, and spring-flowering species are most responsive. However, large interspecific differences in this response will affect both the structure of plant communities and gene flow between species as climate warms. Annuals are more likely to flower early than congeneric perennials, and insect-pollinated species more than wind-pollinated ones.},

@article{Kharouba2018,
	Abstract = {Shifts in the timing of species interactions are often cited as a consequence of climate change and, if present, are expected to have wide-reaching implications for ecological communities. Our knowledge about these shifts mostly comes from single systems, which have provided no clear picture, thus limiting our understanding of how species interactions may be responding overall. Using a new global database based on long-term data on the seasonal timing of biological events for pairwise species interactions, we find that the relative timing of interacting species has changed substantially in recent decades. The observed shifts are greater in magnitude than before recent climate change began, suggesting that there will be widespread warming-related shifts in the synchrony of species in the future.

Phenological responses to climate change (e.g., earlier leaf-out or egg hatch date) are now well documented and clearly linked to rising temperatures in recent decades. Such shifts in the phenologies of interacting species may lead to shifts in their synchrony, with cascading community and ecosystem consequences. To date, single-system studies have provided no clear picture, either finding synchrony shifts may be extremely prevalent [Mayor SJ, et al. (2017) Sci Rep 7:1902] or relatively uncommon [Iler AM, et al. (2013) Glob Chang Biol 19:2348--2359], suggesting that shifts toward asynchrony may be infrequent. A meta-analytic approach would provide insights into global trends and how they are linked to climate change. We compared phenological shifts among pairwise species interactions (e.g., predator--prey) using published long-term time-series data of phenological events from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across four continents since 1951 to determine whether recent climate change has led to overall shifts in synchrony. We show that the relative timing of key life cycle events of interacting species has changed significantly over the past 35 years. Further, by comparing the period before major climate change (pre-1980s) and after, we show that estimated changes in phenology and synchrony are greater in recent decades. However, there has been no consistent trend in the direction of these changes. Our findings show that there have been shifts in the timing of interacting species in recent decades; the next challenges are to improve our ability to predict the direction of change and understand the full consequences for communities and ecosystems.},

@article{Konig2018,
	Abstract = {Aim: Numerous studies have reported changes in first flowering day (FFD-changes) in response to changes in climate. However, regarding the direction (advances versus delays) and the intensity (number of days/decade) of FFD-changes, species show differences even when observed in the same location. Here, we examine the extent to which plant traits can explain observed differences in the response of flowering phenology in trees, shrubs, herbs and grasses. Location: Eighteen sites distributed over the Northern Hemisphere. Methods: We compiled data from the literature on FFD-changes over recent decades for 562 species (648 observations). We related FFD-changes to predictor variables associated with (a) changes in climate, (b) local site conditions and (c) traits. Results: Of all FDD-changes, 80.4{\%} were FFD-advances, 69.9{\%} not exceeding 5 days/decade, and 10.5{\%} exceeding 5 days/decade, whereas 19.6{\%} reported delays. The intensity of FFD-advances could be explained by several predictor variables from all three groups (a--c). The importance of these variables differed between the growth forms. Overall, decreasing precipitation was more important than increasing temperature in explaining FFD-advances. FFD-advances were strongest in polar tundra and in dry and warm habitats. Traits related to competition and growth rate, like plant height, specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content, had substantial explanatory power in the models. Traits had the highest overall importance in trees and grasses. In herbs they were of equal importance with changes in climate. In shrubs, variables related to site conditions best explained the intensity of FFD-advances. Main conclusions: Plant traits are important to understand species-specific and growth form-specific differences in phenological responses to climatic changes. Hence, in future observations and predictions of plant phenology, traits should be taken into consideration, especially those related to competition and growth rate, as they improve our understanding of adaptations leading to phenological changes.},

	Abstract = {There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever produce general principles. We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we have reviewed how the hydraulic design of trees influences the movement of water from roots to leaves. The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even the maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to drought-induced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.},

	Abstract = {1. We hypothesize that flowering phenology correlates with plant height growth pattern and that the pattern is associated with functional traits including maximum plant height (H(max)), RGR, stern tissue mass density (SD), hollow ratio (proportion of central hollow of stem cross-sectional area) and leaf mass per area (LMA) in grassland herbaceous species. 2. We investigated plant height growth trajectories and flower phenology, and measured LMA, SD and hollow ratio for 25 herbaceous species including 20 dicot forb species and five monocot species in an old-field grassland of New England, USA. H(max), RGR, T10 and T90 (Julian day when plant height was 10{\%} and 90{\%} H(max) respectively) were derived from a logistic function for each species and were analysed in relation to LMA and SD. 3. H(max) was positively correlated with T10, T90 and flowering onset time (Julian day when the first 10{\%} of flowers were blossoming) across species and across evolutionary-correlated divergences. Early growing and flowering species were shorter than late ones, and species reaching H(max) earlier flowered earlier than their counterparts. 4. There was a positive relationship between T90 and RGR, in which early growing species were usually at mid-to-high levels of RGR, while late-growing ones had widely varied RGR. A similar relationship was found between flowering onset time and RGR. RGR was significantly negatively correlated with SD and LMA but positively with hollow ratio, as indicated by correlation analysis and phylogenetically independent comparative analysis. 5. Based on the above results, we propose that herbaceous species have two major dimensions of height growth strategies (early vs. late and fast vs. slow growth), collectively resulting in three extreme cases (early and fast, late and slow, and late and fast). Different height growth trajectories resulting from these strategies may reduce asymmetric competition among co-existing species in dense grasslands. 6. Synthesis. Flowering phenology and height growth patterns are significantly associated with functional traits such as RGR, LMA and hollow ratio in herbaceous grassland species. The difference in height growth trajectories and associated functional traits may allow species coexistence possibly at both plant and consumer trophic levels.},
