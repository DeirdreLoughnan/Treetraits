	abstract = {SummaryThe architecture of trees is the result of constrained, morphologically plastic growth -- constrained by an underlying architectural model embedded in their genome, the structure of which can be significantly altered during growth to match the changing environmental conditions to which the tree is exposed. Here, we examined the hypothesis that crowding from neighbours should cause trees to optimize traits for light competition at the expense of wind resistance, with the reverse being true for trees lacking neighbours. Previous studies have examined the influence of light competition or wind resistance on shaping tree architecture, but few, if any, have simultaneously addressed trade‐offs for optimizing these traits in response to crowding from neighbouring trees in forests, as compared to open‐grown conditions.We studied the response of tree‐ and branch‐level architectural traits of temperate, broad‐leaved, deciduous tree species of differing shade tolerance and wood strength from multiple locations across the north‐eastern United States. Trees ranged in size (4--83 cm diameter at 1·3 m) and crowding conditions (open‐ and forest‐grown) and occupied different canopy positions. The open‐grown trees represented a null condition, where the lack of neighbouring trees to shape architectural traits could be contrasted with the influence of different levels of crowding in forests.Our results show strong evidence for a tree neighbourhood‐induced convergence of architectural traits across species and conditions, even when trees are growing in urban rather than natural forest conditions. After accounting for crowding, the effects of species and sample location contributed very little to explaining variation in architectural traits. One exception was crown dimensions, for which species‐specific differences explained about 15\% of the residual variation.Under open‐grown conditions, alleviation of light competition caused trees to develop relatively large crowns and branches and a squat growth form suitable to resist greater wind exposure. By contrast, increasing shading from neighbouring trees caused forest‐grown trees to become increasingly more spindly in the main stem, with slender branches sparsely distributed over a disproportionately large crown volume -- presumably to maximize light capture. Although the latter is an intrinsically less wind‐stable form, it can be adopted to increase light capture because neighbouring trees reduce exposure to the wind, which should greatly reduce the likelihood of stem breakage or uprooting under critical wind pressures.A lay summary is available for this article.},

	abstract = {Leaf phenology varies markedly across tree species of temperate deciduous forests. Early leafing in spring may increase light capture and carbon gain prior to canopy closure, allowing saplings to survive in understory sites deeply shaded in midsummer. We quantified sapling leaf phenology for 18 tree species and seasonal variation in understory light availability at three sites along a ridge-slope-cove landform gradient in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Early leafing species (e.g., Aesculus flava, Carpinus caroliniana ) broke bud an average of 24 d before late leafers (e.g., Magnolia fraseri, Nyssa sylvatica ). Canopy closure occurred 14-18 d earlier and summer understory light was on average 63-74{\%} lower on intermediate and mesic sites than on the xeric site. Early leafing species intercepted 45-80{\%} of their growing season photon flux before canopy closure vs. 8-15{\%} for late leafers. However, earlier leafing increased exposure to freezing temperatures by 5.5{\%} per week near the mean time of bud break. Early leafing is strongly correlated with midsummer shade, risk of freezing temperatures, and distribution on mesic sites across a "main spectrum" of 15 deciduous species. Differences in leaf phenology and resultant impacts on spring carbon gain may help determine tree shade tolerance and distribution in southern Appalachian forests.},

@article{Fitter2002,
	abstract = {The average first flowering date of 385 British plant species has advanced by 4.5 days during the past decade compared with the previous four decades: 16{\%} of species flowered significantly earlier in the 1990s than previously, with an average advancement of 15 days in a decade. Ten species (3{\%}) flowered significantly later in the 1990s than previously. These data reveal the strongest biological signal yet of climatic change. Flowering is especially sensitive to the temperature in the previous month, and spring-flowering species are most responsive. However, large interspecific differences in this response will affect both the structure of plant communities and gene flow between species as climate warms. Annuals are more likely to flower early than congeneric perennials, and insect-pollinated species more than wind-pollinated ones.},

@article{Harrington2015,
	abstract = {Many temperate and boreal tree species have a chilling requirement, that is, they need to experience cold temperatures during fall and winter to burst bud normally in the spring. Results from trials with 11 Pacific Northwest tree species are consistent with the concept that plants can accumulate both chilling and forcing units simultaneously during the dormant season and they exhibit a tradeoff between amount of forcing and chilling. That is, the parallel model of chilling and forcing was effective in predicting budburst and well chilled plants require less forcing for bud burst than plants which have received less chilling. Genotypes differed in the shape of the possibility line which describes the quantitative tradeoff between chilling and forcing units. Plants which have an obligate chilling requirement (Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western larch, pines, and true firs) and received no or very low levels of chilling did not burst bud normally even with long photoperiods. Pacific madrone and western redcedar benefited from chilling in terms of requiring less forcing to promote bud burst but many plants burst bud normally without chilling. Equations predicting budburst were developed for each species in our trials for a portion of western North America under current climatic conditions and for 2080. Mean winter temperature was predicted to increase 3.2--5.5$\,^{\circ}$C and this change resulted in earlier predicted budburst for Douglas-fir throughout much of our study area (up to 74 days earlier) but later budburst in some southern portions of its current range (up to 48 days later) as insufficient chilling is predicted to occur. Other species all had earlier predicted dates of budburst by 2080 than currently. Recent warming trends have resulted in earlier budburst for some woody plant species; however, the substantial winter warming predicted by some climate models will reduce future chilling in some locations such that budburst will not consistently occur earlier.},

@article{wright1999,
	abstract = {1 Species‐pairs from woody dicot lineages were chosen as phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) to represent evolutionary divergences along gradients of rainfall and nutrient stress, and within particular habitat types, in New South Wales, Australia. Seedlings were grown under controlled, favourable conditions and measurements were made for various growth, morphological and allocation traits. 2 Trait correlations across all species were identified, particularly with respect to seedling relative growth rate (RGR) and specific leaf area (SLA), a fundamental measure of allocation strategy that reflects the light‐capture area deployed per unit of photosynthate invested in leaves. 3 Across all species, SLA, specific root length (SRL) and seed reserve mass were the strongest predictors of seedling RGR. That is, a syndrome of leaf and root surface maximization and low seed mass was typical of high RGR plants. This may be a high‐risk strategy for individual seedlings, but one presumably mitigated by a larger number of seedlings being produced, increasing the chance that at least one will find itself in a favourable situation. 4 Syndromes of repeated attribute divergence were identified in the two sets of gradient PICs. Species from lower resource habitats generally had lower SLA. Thus, in this important respect the two gradients appeared to be variants of a more general `stress' gradient. 5 However, trends in biomass allocation, tissue density, root morphology and seed reserve mass differed between gradients. While SLA and RGR tended to shift together along gradients and in within‐habitat PICs, no single attribute emerged as the common, primary factor driving RGR divergences within contrasts. Within‐habitat attribute shifts were of similar magnitude to those along gradients.},

@article{Yin2016,
	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society. Non-native understorey woody species have been shown to extend leaf display and inhabit vacant phenological niches in early spring and late autumn when growing with native counterparts in temperate deciduous forests across the world. Despite the potential competitive advantages, extended leaf duration also subjects non-native species to possible hydraulic risks associated with maintaining leaves during periods of increased frost probability. It remains unclear how non-native species are able to maintain xylem function within this context. Leaf phenology in temperate deciduous trees has been shown to be a function of xylem anatomy, with earlier bud break associated with smaller xylem vessels due to the presumed resistance of smaller vessels to freezing-induced cavitation. We examined relationships between leaf phenology and xylem vessel traits across 82 native and non-native understorey deciduous woody species common to eastern U.S. deciduous forests. We hypothesized that non-native species possess xylem vessel traits associated with maximum hydraulic safety during frost-prone spring and autumn leaf display without compromising rapid growth rate. Larger metaxylem vessels in non-native species were associated with both faster spring growth and delayed autumn leaf fall compared to native species. Non-native species also had smaller latewood vessel diameter, latewood vessel area percentage and a higher proportion of solitary vessels in the entire secondary xylem cross section compared to natives, potentially increasing their resistance to freezing- and/or drought-induced cavitation in autumn, thus allowing for delayed autumn leaf fall. Native and non-native species exhibited similar dates of spring bud break and leaf emergence, consistent with similar xylem vessel size and vessel area percentage within metaxylem and earlywood. Within both groups, species with earlier bud and leaf emergence had a higher total percentage of vessel area within metaxylem and earlywood. This suggests understorey species need sufficient water to support their early spring growth at the risk of freezing-induced cavitation. Our study suggests xylem vessel properties, along with cross-sectional spatial xylem vessel distribution, reflect the capacity of non-native plants to thrive in a new environment and deepen our understanding of the physiological mechanisms of successful invasions of non-native understorey woody plant species.},

@article{Osada2017,
	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Timing of budburst (DBB) may be related to the functional traits and distributions of woody species in temperate regions. Although many previous studies have investigated DBB in a number of temperate species, it has seldom been linked to multiple plant trait relationships. METHODS: DBB and plant traits were investigated for 24 woody species for 2 years in a warm-temperate secondary forest in Japan. Particular attention was paid to differences in trait relationships between coexisting deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved species. KEY RESULTS: DBB was correlated with plant traits in deciduous but not evergreen broad-leaved species; DBB was later for deciduous species with greater leaf mass, leaf area, vessel diameter, and leaf nitrogen content per unit mass. In addition, DBB was later for species with more northern distributions in deciduous and evergreen species. CONCLUSIONS: Clear differences in the trait relationships between deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved species might be caused by different selection pressures on DBB; selection is expected to be more severe in deciduous species. Overall, the continuous variable of vessel diameter might be used as a simple and effective trait to predict DBB of deciduous species regardless of wood anatomy; however, no such traits were detected as effective predictors of DBB in evergreen species at this study site. In addition, DBB was earlier for the species of more southern distributions, suggesting that such species benefit more from warming.},

	abstract = {Spring leaf phenology strongly influences plant productivity in temperate deciduous forests. Many studies have detected earlier budburst and leaf maturation in smaller trees within species, and have discussed the adaptive significance of increasing carbon gain before canopy closure in small trees. However, some previous studies have found the opposite pattern, and the physiological and environmental bases for this discrepancy are incompletely understood. We investigated the spring leaf phenology of 11 deciduous species in a cool-temperate forest in Japan for 2 years with different amounts of snowfall, and also gathered data on the day of budburst from multiple studies to assess whether and how the timing of budburst is related to tree size, phylogeny, temperature and annual snowfall of study sites. We found that differences in the timing of budburst and leaf maturation between saplings ({\textless}1 m height) and short trees (1--10 m height) are larger than those between short trees and tall trees ({\textgreater}10 m height), resulting in non-linear relationships between timing and height in most species. Cumulative degree-days to the day of budburst were smaller in saplings than in tall trees, probably because saplings are selected to outcompete the other individuals/species to become established. Moreover, phylogenetic relatedness did not explain the difference in spring leaf phenology between saplings and tall trees in the literature survey. In addition, our literature survey showed that budburst occurred earlier in saplings of most species in sites with less snowfall, whereas budburst occurred earlier in tall trees at sites with heavy snowfall. These results suggest that the opposite patterns found in some studies may be due to (i) differences in the target size, as saplings show larger phenological discrepancies than short and tall trees, and (ii) the microclimate experienced by the tree, as sites with heavy snow show delayed sapling phenology.},

@article{macfarlane2020,
	abstract = {Wood density is strongly related to key aspects of tree physiological performance. While many studies have examined wood density in different parts of trees, for a variety of reasons, there are very few studies that have compared within-tree density variation across many trees, of many species, drawn from a large geographic area. Here, a large data set representing thousands of trees of 78 species/genera, drawn from hundreds of sites in the Eastern United States, was compiled and analyzed to explore branch to main stem wood basic density relationships. It was expected that differences in stem vs. branch wood density among trees would be due to both genetic constraints and plastic responses in wood properties, due to tree growth responses to external environments. The results show a wide tree-to-tree variation in average branch density, relative to main stem density. However, there was a general pattern for overstory tree species to have high tree branch density relative to stem density at lower stem densities, and a declining branch to stem wood density ratio as stem density increased. Evergreen gymnosperms showed the strongest change in branch to stem wood density ratios over the range of stem wood densities and deciduous angiosperms the least; deciduous gymnosperms showed an intermediate pattern, but with generally higher branch- than stem- wood densities. More cold-hearty, shade-tolerant/drought-intolerant, evergreen gymnosperms, growing at higher latitudes, showed higher branch to stem density ratios than more shade-intolerant/drought tolerant evergreen gymnosperms growing at lower latitudes. Across all trees, canopy position had a significant influence on branch to stem density relationships, with higher branch to stem density ratios for canopy dominant trees and successively lower branch to stem density ratios for trees in successively inferior canopy positions (in terms of light availability). Understory tree species, which remain in the forest understory at maximum height, showed generally lower branch than stem densities over a wide range of stem densities. The results suggested that tradeoffs between mechanical safety and whole-tree hydraulic conductance are driving within-tree differences in wood density and highlighted the need for more detailed examinations of within-tree density variation at the whole-tree level.},

@article{macfarlane2017,
	abstract = {SummaryThe architecture of trees is the result of constrained, morphologically plastic growth -- constrained by an underlying architectural model embedded in their genome, the structure of which can be significantly altered during growth to match the changing environmental conditions to which the tree is exposed. Here, we examined the hypothesis that crowding from neighbours should cause trees to optimize traits for light competition at the expense of wind resistance, with the reverse being true for trees lacking neighbours. Previous studies have examined the influence of light competition or wind resistance on shaping tree architecture, but few, if any, have simultaneously addressed trade‐offs for optimizing these traits in response to crowding from neighbouring trees in forests, as compared to open‐grown conditions.We studied the response of tree‐ and branch‐level architectural traits of temperate, broad‐leaved, deciduous tree species of differing shade tolerance and wood strength from multiple locations across the north‐eastern United States. Trees ranged in size (4--83 cm diameter at 1·3 m) and crowding conditions (open‐ and forest‐grown) and occupied different canopy positions. The open‐grown trees represented a null condition, where the lack of neighbouring trees to shape architectural traits could be contrasted with the influence of different levels of crowding in forests.Our results show strong evidence for a tree neighbourhood‐induced convergence of architectural traits across species and conditions, even when trees are growing in urban rather than natural forest conditions. After accounting for crowding, the effects of species and sample location contributed very little to explaining variation in architectural traits. One exception was crown dimensions, for which species‐specific differences explained about 15\% of the residual variation.Under open‐grown conditions, alleviation of light competition caused trees to develop relatively large crowns and branches and a squat growth form suitable to resist greater wind exposure. By contrast, increasing shading from neighbouring trees caused forest‐grown trees to become increasingly more spindly in the main stem, with slender branches sparsely distributed over a disproportionately large crown volume -- presumably to maximize light capture. Although the latter is an intrinsically less wind‐stable form, it can be adopted to increase light capture because neighbouring trees reduce exposure to the wind, which should greatly reduce the likelihood of stem breakage or uprooting under critical wind pressures.A lay summary is available for this article.},

@article{Zanne2010,
	abstract = {Woody stems comprise a large biological carbon fraction and determine water transport between roots and leaves; their structure and function can influence both carbon and hydrological cycles. While angiosperm wood anatomy and density determine hydraulic conductivity and mechanical strength, little is known about interrelations across many species. We compiled a global data set comprising two anatomical traits for 3005 woody angiosperms: mean vessel lumen area ({\=A}) and number per unit area (N). From these, we calculated vessel lumen fraction (F = {\=A}N) and size to number ratio (S = {\=A}/N), a new vessel composition index. We examined the extent to which F and S influenced potential sapwood specific stem conductivity (KS) and wood density (D; dry mass/fresh volume). F and S varied essentially independently across angiosperms. Variation in KS was driven primarily by S, and variation in D was virtually unrelated to F and S. Tissue density outside vessel lumens (DN) must predominantly influence D. High S should confer faster KS but incur greater freeze--thaw embolism risk. F should also affect KS, and both F and DN should influence mechanical strength, capacitance, and construction costs. Improved theory and quantification are needed to better understand ecological costs and benefits of these three distinct dimensions.},

Results: Mean annual temperature was significantly more strongly correlated with plant traits than was mean annual precipitation.
Conclusions: Our study provides support for some of the assumptions of classical vegetation theory, and points to many interesting directions for future research. The relatively low R2 values for precipitation might reflect the weak link between mean annual precipitation and the availability of water to plants.},

In antagonistic trophic interactions, any mismatch will have negative impacts for only one of the species, whereas in mutualistic interactions, both partners are expected to suffer. Trophic mismatch is therefore expected to last for evolutionarily short periods, perhaps only a few seasons, adding to the difficulty of attributing it to climate change, which requires long-term data. So far, the prediction that diverging phenologies linked to climate change will cause mismatch is most clearly met in antagonistic interactions at high latitudes in the Artic.

	abstract = {A comprehensive understanding of species phenological responses to global warming will require observations that are both long-term and spatially extensive. Here we present an analysis of the spring phenological response to climate variation of twelve taxa: six plants, three birds, a frog, and two insects. Phenology was monitored using standardized protocols at 176 meteorological stations in Japan and South Korea from 1953 to 2005, and in some cases even longer. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to examine the complex interactions of temperature, site effects, and latitude on phenology. Results show species-specific variation in the magnitude and even in the direction of their responses to increasing temperature, which also differ from site-to-site. At most sites the differences in phenology among species are forecast to become greater with warmer temperatures. Our results challenge the assertion that trends in one geographic region can be extrapolated to others, and emphasize the idiosyncratic nature of the species response to global warming. Field studies are needed to determine how these patterns of variation in species response to climate change affect species interactions and the ability to persist in a changing climate.},

@article{Flynn2018,
	abstract = {Accurate predictions of spring plant phenology with climate change are critical for projec-tions of growing seasons, plant communities and a number of ecosystem services, including carbon storage. Progress towards prediction, however, has been slow because the major cues known to drive phenology -- temperature (including winter chilling and spring forcing) and photoperiod -- generally covary in nature and may interact, making accurate predictions of plant responses to climate change complex and nonlinear. Alternatively, recent work sug-gests many species may be dominated by one cue, which would make predictions much simpler. Here, we manipulated all three cues across 28 woody species from two North American forests. All species responded to all cues examined. Chilling exerted a strong effect, especially on budburst ({\`{A}}15.8 d), with responses to forcing and photoperiod greatest for leafout ({\`{A}}19.1 and {\`{A}}11.2 d, respectively). Interactions between chilling and forcing suggest that each cue may compensate somewhat for the other. Cues varied across species, leading to staggered leafout within each community and supporting the idea that phenology is a critical aspect of species' temporal niches. Our results suggest that predicting the spring phenology of communities will be difficult, as all species we studied could have complex, nonlinear responses to future warming.},

              n
              = 865 studies) to examine the contexts in which traits may be used for global change prediction. We find that exponential growth in the field over the last decade remains dominated by descriptive studies of terrestrial plant morphology, highlighting significant opportunities to expand trait-based thinking across systems and taxa. Very few studies (less than 3\%) focus on predicting ecological effects of global change, mostly in the past 5 years and via singular traits that mediate abiotic limits on species distribution. Beyond organism size (the most examined trait), we identify over 2500 other morphological, physiological, behavioural and life-history traits known to mediate environmental filters of species' range and abundance as candidates for future predictive global change work. Though uncommon, spatially explicit process models---which mechanistically link traits to changes in organism distributions and abundance---are among the most promising frameworks for holistic global change prediction at scales relevant for conservation decision-making. Further progress towards trait-based forecasting requires addressing persistent barriers including (1) matching scales of multivariate trait and environment data to focal processes disrupted by global change, and (2) propagating variation in trait and environmental parameters throughout process model functions using simulation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              
                
                  Of the several approaches that are used to analyse functional trait--environment relationships, the most popular is community‐weighted mean regressions (CWMr) in which species trait values are averaged at the site level and then regressed against environmental variables. Other approaches include model‐based methods and weighted correlations of different metrics of trait--environment associations, the best known of which is the fourth‐corner correlation method.
                
                
                  
                    We investigated these three general statistical approaches for trait--environment associations:
                    CWM
                    r, five weighted correlation metrics (Peres‐Neto, Dray, \& ter Braak,
                    Ecography
                    , 40, 806--816, 2017), and two multilevel models (
                    MLM
                    ) using four different methods for computing
                    p
                    ‐values. We first compared the methods applied to a plant community dataset. To determine the validity of the statistical conclusions, we then performed a simulation study.
                  
                
                
                  
                    CWM
                    r gave highly significant associations for both traits, whereas the other methods gave a mix of support.
                    CWM
                    r had inflated type I errors for some simulation scenarios, implying that the significant results for the data could be spurious. The weighted correlation methods had generally good type I error control but had low power. One of the multilevel models, that from Jamil, Ozinga, Kleyer, and ter Braak (
                    Journal of Vegetation Science
                    , 24, 988--1000, 2013) had both good type I error control and high power when an appropriate method was used to obtain
                    p
                    ‐values. In particular, if there was no correlation among species in their abundances among sites, a parametric bootstrap likelihood ratio test (
                    LRT
                    ) gave the best power. When there was correlation among species in their abundances, a conditional parametric
                    LRT
                    had correct type I errors but had lower power.
                  
                
                
                  
                    There is no overall best method for identifying trait--environment associations. For the simple task of testing associations between single environmental variables and single traits, the weighted correlations with permutation tests all had good type I error control, and their ease of implementation is an advantage. For the more complex task of multivariate analyses and model fitting, and when high statistical power is needed, we recommend
                    MLM
                    2 (Jamil et al., 2013). However, care must be taken to ensure against inflated type I errors for both weighted correlations and MLM2. Because
                    CWM
                    r exhibited highly inflated type I error rates, it should always be avoided.},

@article{Peresneto2017,
	abstract = {Establishing trait--environment relationships has become routine in community ecology. Here, we demonstrate that the community weighted means correlation (CWM) and its parallel approach in linking trait variation to the environment, the species niche centroid correlation (SNC), have important shortcomings, arguing against their continuing application. Using mathematical derivations and simulations, we show that the two major issues are inconsistent parameter estimation and unacceptable significance rates when only the environment or only traits are structuring species distributions, but they themselves are not linked. We show how both CWM and SNC are related to the fourth‐corner correlation and propose to replace all by the Chessel fourth‐corner correlation, which is the fourth‐corner correlation divided by its maximum attainable value. We propose an appropriate hypothesis testing procedure that is not only unbiased but also has much greater statistical power in detecting trait--environmental relationships. We derive an additive framework in which trait variation is partitioned among and within communities, which can be then modeled against the environment. We finish by presenting a contrast between methods and an application of our proposed framework across 85 lake‐fish metacommunities.},

@article{Pollock2012,
	abstract = {Quantifying how functional traits relate to environmental gradients provides insight into mechanisms governing species distributions. Here, we bring together the fields of species distribution modelling and functional trait ecology with hierarchical modelling by explicitly incorporating traits into a multi‐species distribution model. We combined traits from the leaf‐height‐seed strategy scheme (specific leaf area (SLA), plant height and seed mass) with a distribution model for 20 eucalypt taxa in Victoria, Australia.
            The key insight of this approach is how traits modulate species responses to environmental gradients. The strongest link was between SLA and percent rock cover (species with low SLA had positive responses to rockiness, whereas high SLA species responded negatively to rockiness). We found evidence for complex yet potentially important interactions. For instance, the probability of species occurrence increased with rainfall and solar radiation on average yet the response varied depending on species height and SLA. Tall species were predicted to increase with rainfall and solar radiation across the range of SLA values (tall species with low SLA were especially sensitive to rainfall). Short species responded positively to rainfall and solar radiation only if they had low SLA.
            This framework readily accounts for interactions between combinations of traits and environmental variables unlike multi‐step approaches. Further application of this concept will contribute to a generalized mechanistic understanding of how traits influence species distributions along environmental gradients, with implications for understanding the response of species to global change.},

To address this deficiency, we partitioned the variance in two key functional traits (leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content) across six nested ecological scales (site, plot, species, tree, strata and leaf) in lowland tropical rainforests. In both traits, the plot level shows virtually no variance despite high species turnover among plots and the size of withinspecies variation (leaf + strata + tree) is comparable with that of species level variation. The lack of variance at the plot level brings substantial support to the idea that traitbased environmental filtering plays a central role in plant community assembly. These results and the finding that the amount of within-species variation is comparable with interspecific variation support a shift of focus from species-based to trait-based ecology.},

                    There is a growing consensus that the distribution of species trait values in a community can greatly determine ecosystem processes and services delivery. Two distinct components of community trait composition are hypothesized to chiefly affect ecosystem processes: (i) the average trait value of the species, quantified by community‐weighted mean trait values (
                    CWM
                    ; related to the mass ratio hypothesis) and (ii) the degree to which trait values differ between species in a community, quantified by different indices of functional diversity (
                    FD
                    ; related to non‐additive community effects). The uncertainty on the relative effect of these two components is stimulating an increasing number of empirical studies testing their effects on ecosystem processes and services delivery.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We suggest, however, that the interdependence between
                    CWM
                    and
                    FD
                    poses a challenge on disentangling their relative importance. We present a framework that allows designing experiments to decouple and assess the effects of these two community functional components on ecosystem processes and services. To illustrate the framework, we focused on leaf litter decomposition, as this is an essential process related to important ecosystem services. Using simulations, we applied the framework for plant leaf litter traits (litter nitrogen and phenolic content) that are related to litter decomposition.
                  
                
                
                  
                    CWM
                    and
                    FD
                    generally showed a hump‐shaped relationship (i.e. at more extreme
                    CWM
                    values, communities can have only low
                    FD
                    values). Within this relationship, we showed that it is possible to select quasi‐orthogonal combinations of
                    CWM
                    and
                    FD
                    that can be treated statistically. Within these orthogonal
                    CWM
                    and
                    FD
                    combinations, it is also possible to select species assemblages controlling for other community parameters, such as total biomass, total density and species richness.

@article{Gross2000,
	abstract = {A major challenge in evaluating patterns of species richness and productivity involves acquiring data to examine these relationships empirically across a range of ecologically significant spatial scales. In this paper, we use data from herb‐dominated plant communities at six Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites to examine how the relationship between plant species density and above‐ground net primary productivity (ANPP) differs when the spatial scale of analysis is changed. We quantified this relationship at different spatial scales in which we varied the focus and extent of analysis: (1) among fields within communities, (2) among fields within biomes or biogeographic regions, and (3) among communities within biomes or biogeographic regions. We used species density (
              D
              =number of species per m
              2
              ) as our measure of diversity to have a comparable index across all sites and scales. Although we expected unimodal relationships at all spatial scales, we found that spatial scale influenced the form of the relationship. At the scale of fields within different grassland communities, we detected a significant relationship at only one site (Minnesota old‐fields), and it was negative linear. When we expanded the extent of analyses to biogeographic regions (grasslands or North America), we found significant unimodal relationships in both cases. However, when we combined data to examine patterns among community types within different biogeographic regions (grassland, alpine tundra, arctic tundra, or North America), we did not detect significant relationships between species density and ANPP for any region. The results of our analyses demonstrate that the spatial scale of analysis -- how data are aggregated and patterns examined -- can influence the form of the relationship between species density and productivity. It also demonstrates the need for data sets from a broad spectrum of sites sampled over a range of scales for examining challenging and controversial ecological hypotheses.},

@article{Wright2003,
	abstract = {There is considerable interest in determining whether the species richness of communities is determined by forces controlling dispersal into patches that operate at the landscape scale, or forces controlling persistence that act at the local scale. Understanding the relative importance of these two classes of factors in controlling within-patch species richness is particularly important when patches are created via ecosystem engineering. In such cases, factors affecting the population dynamics or behavior of a single species could indirectly affect species richness if richness is controlled primarily by landscape-level factors. We used a combination of experimental mesocosms and field observations to determine whether species richness in beaver wetlands in the Adirondack Mountains (New York) is more strongly controlled by the position of the wetland in the landscape or by within-wetland hydrology. Drainage rate had a significant effect on both richness and composition in mesocosms, with well-drained treatments having significantly higher richness than poorly drained treatments. Seed germinated from the seed bank in sediments collected from different ponds showed relatively small differences in richness or community composition in mesocosms, suggesting a comparatively small effect of dispersal limitation on species richness. Experimental results were mirrored in a survey of 14 meadows over two years, which indicated that variability in water table depth was consistently a significant predictor of species richness, while meadow area and isolation showed little relation to richness. The survey also suggested that the number of years since beaver had abandoned a site was a significant predictor of the number of species found in beaver meadows. The results indicate that species richness in beaver meadows is strongly controlled by local factors, but that the population dynamics of beaver could also potentially affect species richness by altering the age distribution of meadows across the landscape.},

@article{Violle2007,
	abstract = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait‐based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term ``trait'' itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the ``performance paradigm'' to plant ecology. ``Functional traits'' are defined as morpho‐physio‐phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing ``integration functions'' which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

	abstract = {Ecologists need a common language of plant traits in order to make comparisons across regions and scales, pool data, and maximize the utility of the data. To develop such a set of traits we began with the primary challenges faced by plants: dispersal, establishment, and persistence in order to identify fundamental traits. Most of these traits are hard to measure, but advances in comparative ecology have suggested a number of easy to measure analogs. Unfortunately, some of the fundamental traits have no simple analog. The common, core list includes: seed mass, seed shape, dispersal mode, clonality, specific leaf area, leaf water content, height, above-ground biomass, life history, onset of flowering, stem density, and resprouting ability. Most of the traits can be measured quantitatively, but several traits on the list must still be measured qualitatively due to logistical problems or lack of an easy analog. Key problem areas include: dispersal ability, capacity for vegetative spread, germination, palatability, plasticity, and all the various below-ground traits. Comparative studies need to address these problem areas. The common core list is suggested as a common starting point for studies of functional ecology. The idiosyncrasies of regional floras and specific research agendas will dictate which traits can be ignored and those that need to be added.},

	abstract = {A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme is proposed. The axes would be specific leaf area SLA (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass allocated), height of the plant's canopy at maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes. The advantages of the LHS scheme can be understood by comparing it to Grime's CSR scheme, which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The CSR triangle is widely cited as expressing important strategic variation between species. The C-S axis reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities for rapid growth; in the LHS scheme, SLA reflects the same type of variation. The R axis reflects coping with disturbance; in the LHS scheme, height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of coping with disturbance. A plant ecology strategy scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be readily positioned within the scheme could bring substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of experimental results, for placing detailed ecophysiology in context, and for coping with questions posed by global change. In the CSR triangle the axes are defined by reference to concepts, there is no simple protocol for positioning species beyond the reference datasets within the scheme, and consequently benefits of worldwide comparison have not materialized. LHS does permit any vascular land plant species to be positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming measurement of metabolic rates or of field performance relative to other species. The merits of the LHS scheme reside (it is argued) in this potential for worldwide comparison, more than in superior explanatory power within any particular vegetation region. The LHS scheme avoids also two other difficulties with the CSR scheme: (a) It does not prejudge that there are no viable strategies under high stress and high disturbance (the missing quadrant in the CSR triangle compared to a two-axis rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct aspects of the response to disturbance, height at maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a distance. The advantage of LHS axes defined through a single readily-measured variable needs to be weighed against the disadvantage that single plant traits may not capture as much strategy variation as CSR's multi-trait axes. It is argued that the benefits of potential worldwide comparison do actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of meaningful variation between species that is captured. Further, the LHS scheme opens the path to quantifying what proportion of variation in any other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with the LHS axes. This quantification could help us to move forward from unprofitable debates of the past 30 years, where CSR opponents have emphasized patterns that were not accommodated within the scheme, while CSR proponents have emphasized patterns that the scheme did account for.},

	abstract = {The tissue traits and architectures of plant species are important for land-plant ecology in two ways. First, they control ecosystem processes and define habitat and resources for other taxa; thus, they are a high priority for understanding the ecosystem at a site. Second, knowledge of trait costs and benefits offers the most promising path to understanding how vegetation properties change along physical geography gradients. There exists an informal shortlist of plant traits that are thought to be most informative. Here, we summarize recent research on correlations and tradeoffs surrounding some traits that are prospects for the shortlist. By extending the list and by developing better models for how traits influence species distributions and interactions, a strong foundation of basic ecology can be established, with many practical applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {One of ecology's grand challenges is developing general rules to explain and predict highly complex systems. Understanding and predicting ecological processes from species' traits has been considered a `Holy Grail' in ecology. Plant functional traits are increasingly being used to develop mechanistic models that can predict how ecological communities will respond to abiotic and biotic perturbations and how species will affect ecosystem function and services in a rapidly changing world; however, significant challenges remain. In this review, we highlight recent work and outstanding questions in three areas: (i) selecting relevant traits; (ii) describing intraspecific trait variation and incorporating this variation into models; and (iii) scaling trait data to community-and ecosystem-level processes. Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in the characterization of plant strategies based on traits and trait relationships, and the integration of traits into multivariate indices and models of community and ecosystem function. However, the utility of trait-based approaches in ecology will benefit from efforts that demonstrate how these traits and indices influence organismal, community, and ecosystem processes across vegetation types, which may be achieved through meta-analysis and enhancement of trait databases. Additionally, intraspecific trait variation and species interactions need to be incorporated into predictive models using tools such as Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Finally, existing models linking traits to community and ecosystem processes need to be empirically tested for their applicability to be realized.},

@article{Basler2014,
	abstract = {Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to temperature and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to temperature and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in Acer pseudoplatanus L., Fagus sylvatica L., Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl. and Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent temperature and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is temperature dependent only, except for Fagus, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by temperature and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species Fagus, Quercus and Picea). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

              1.
              Functional traits are increasingly used to investigate community structure, ecosystem functioning or to classify species into functional groups. These functional traits are expected to be variable between and within species. Intraspecific functional variability is supposed to influence and modulate species responses to environmental changes and their effects on their environment. However, this hypothesis remains poorly tested and species are mostly described by mean trait values without any consideration of variability in individual trait values.
            
            
              2.
              In this study, we quantify the extent of intraspecific plant functional trait variability, its spatial structure and its response to environmental factors. Using a sampling design structured along two direct and orthogonal climatic gradients in an alpine valley, we quantified and analysed the intraspecific variability for three functional traits (height, leaf dry matter content and leaf nitrogen content) measured on sixteen plant species with contrasting life histories.
            
            
              3.
              Results showed a large variability of traits within species with large discrepancies between functional traits and species. This variability did not appear to be structured within populations. Between populations, the overall variability was partly explained by the selected gradients. Despite the strong effects of temperature and radiation on trait intraspecific variability, the response curves of traits along gradients were partly idiosyncratic.
            
            
              4.
              Synthesis
              . Giving a comprehensive quantification of intraspecific functional variability through the analysis of an original data set, we report new evidence that using a single trait value to describe a given species can hide large functional variation for this species along environmental gradients. These findings suggest that intraspecific functional variability should be a concern for ecologists and its recognition opens new opportunities to better understand and predict ecological patterns in a changing environment. Further analyses are, however, required to compare inter‐ and intraspecific variability.},

              1.
               Functional traits have been extensively used to describe, group and rank species according to their functions. There is now growing evidence that intraspecific functional variability, as well as interspecific variability, can have significant effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. A core hypothesis for the use of functional traits expressed as species means, that their intraspecific variability is negligible compared with their interspecific variability, has however been too rarely tested empirically. We then addressed four questions: Is intraspecific functional variability across species ranges negligible compared with interspecific variability? Are the major resource economics trade‐off and functional strategies robust to individual trait variability? Are species rankings or ordination robust across species ranges once considering intraspecific variability? Can species be discriminated by their leaf traits?
            
            
              2.
               Using an environmentally stratified sampling design within an alpine catchment, we collected five functional traits for 13 common plant species with contrasting life histories and traits. Several populations from a range of environmental conditions were then sampled for each species across their ranges.
            
            
              3.
               With an original combination of single‐trait and multi‐trait analyses, we highlighted a non‐negligible contribution of intraspecific variability to overall functional trait variability (∼30\%). Although not affecting general and well‐known functional trade‐offs and strategies, intraspecific functional variability had the potential to alter species ordination and produced a functional continuum rather than a clear‐cut species classification.
            
            
              4.
               Deciding whether intraspecific functional variability can be considered as negligible -- species being represented by mean trait values --, or not -- species being represented by multivariate trait distributions --, is an essential question for multiple ecological issues. However, this decision cannot be generic, but will depend on the studied system and selected traits and species, as well as on study objectives.},

	abstract = {Methods: This study examines seven plant functional traits for 12 arctic species. Traits were measured on 10 individuals of each species at each region and analyzed using one--way ANOVA and variance partitioning via nested ANOVA.
Results: Comparison of mean trait values across the three regions for each species showed considerable variability within a growth form. Within deciduous shrubs, for example, one species increased in specific leaf area (SLA) with latitude while another species decreased. Results from variance partitioning differed among functional traits. Across the three regions, plant height, leaf area, SLA, leaf thickness, and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) had relatively low amounts of intraspecific variation (ITV; {\textless}15\%) while normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) had a high amount of ITV ({\textgreater}50\%). All traits showed significant differences across regions for at least some species.
Conclusions: Because our results showed considerable variability in levels of ITV among functional traits, we emphasize the need to investigate ITV in trait--based studies spanning multiple regions. Levels of ITV are important in determining how different populations respond to local environmental conditions. Incorporating ITV in studies investigating vegetation change with warming will provide more robust and reliable predictions.},

	abstract = {Wood performs several essential functions in plants, including mechanically supporting aboveground tissue, storing water and other resources, and transporting sap. Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the {\^O}leaf economics spectrum{\~O}, a similar {\^O}wood economics spectrum{\~O} may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

                  Macroclimatic variation along latitudinal gradients provides an excellent natural laboratory to investigate the role of temperature and the potential impacts of climate warming on terrestrial organisms.
                
                
                  Here, we review the use of latitudinal gradients for ecological climate change research, in comparison with altitudinal gradients and experimental warming, and illustrate their use and caveats with a meta‐analysis of latitudinal intraspecific variation in important life‐history traits of vascular plants.
                
                
                  
                    We first provide an overview of latitudinal patterns in temperature and other abiotic and biotic environmental variables in terrestrial ecosystems. We then assess the latitudinal intraspecific variation present in five key life‐history traits [plant height, specific leaf area (
                    SLA
                    ), foliar nitrogen:phosphorus (
                    N
                    :
                    P
                    ) stoichiometry, seed mass and root:shoot (
                    R
                    :
                    S
                    ) ratio] in natural populations or common garden experiments across a total of 98 plant species.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Intraspecific leaf
                    N:P
                    ratio and seed mass significantly decreased with latitude in natural populations. Conversely, the plant height decreased and
                    SLA
                    increased significantly with latitude of population origin in common garden experiments. However, less than a third of the investigated latitudinal transect studies also formally disentangled the effects of temperature from other environmental drivers which potentially hampers the translation from latitudinal effects into a temperature signal.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis
                    . Latitudinal gradients provide a methodological set‐up to overcome the drawbacks of other observational and experimental warming methods. Our synthesis indicates that many life‐history traits of plants vary with latitude but the translation of latitudinal clines into responses to temperature is a crucial step. Therefore, especially adaptive differentiation of populations and confounding environmental factors other than temperature need to be considered. More generally, integrated approaches of observational studies along temperature gradients, experimental methods and common garden experiments increasingly emerge as the way forward to further our understanding of species and community responses to climate warming.},

	abstract = {One of ecology's grand challenges is developing general rules to explain and predict highly complex systems. Understanding and predicting ecological processes from species' traits has been considered a `Holy Grail' in ecology. Plant functional traits are increasingly being used to develop mechanistic models that can predict how ecological communities will respond to abiotic and biotic perturbations and how species will affect ecosystem function and services in a rapidly changing world; however, significant challenges remain. In this review, we highlight recent work and outstanding questions in three areas: (i) selecting relevant traits; (ii) describing intraspecific trait variation and incorporating this variation into models; and (iii) scaling trait data to community- and ecosystem-level processes. Over the past decade, there have been significant advances in the characterization of plant strategies based on traits and trait relationships, and the integration of traits into multivariate indices and models of community and ecosystem function. However, the utility of trait-based approaches in ecology will benefit from efforts that demonstrate how these traits and indices influence organismal, community, and ecosystem processes across vegetation types, which may be achieved through meta-analysis and enhancement of trait databases. Additionally, intraspecific trait variation and species interactions need to be incorporated into predictive models using tools such as Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Finally, existing models linking traits to community and ecosystem processes need to be empirically tested for their applicability to be realized.},

                  The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water -- the third key resource --stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade‐off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.
                
                
                  Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).
                
                
                  There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole‐plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species.
                
                
                  Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait‐based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up -- fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Many organisms use environmental cues to time events in their annual cycle, such as reproduction and migration, with the appropriate timing of such events impacting survival and reproduction. As the climate changes, evolved mechanisms of cue use may facilitate or limit the capacity of organisms to adjust phenology accordingly, and organisms often integrate multiple cues to fine-tune the timing of annual events. Yet, our understanding of how suites of cues are integrated to generate observed patterns of seasonal timing remains nascent. We present an overarching framework to describe variation in the process of cue integration in the context of seasonal timing. This framework incorporates both cue dependency and cue interaction. We then summarize how existing empirical findings across a range of vertebrate species and life cycle events fit into this framework. Finally, we use a theoretical model to explore how variation in modes of cue integration may impact the ability of organisms to adjust phenology adaptively in the face of climate change. Such a theoretical approach can facilitate the exploration of complex scenarios that present challenges to study in vivo but capture important complexity of the natural world.},

@article{Menzel2006,
	abstract = {Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus, numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season. However, published single-site or single-species studies are particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than 125000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21 European countries (1971-2000). Our results showed that 78{\%} of all leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30{\%} significantly) and only 3{\%} were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5 days decade-1 in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by 2.5 days $\,^{\circ}$C-1, delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day $\,^{\circ}$C-1). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently matches measured national warming across 19 European countries (correlation coefficient r = -0.69, P {\textless} 0.001). {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Kharouba2018,
	abstract = {Shifts in the timing of species interactions are often cited as a consequence of climate change and, if present, are expected to have wide-reaching implications for ecological communities. Our knowledge about these shifts mostly comes from single systems, which have provided no clear picture, thus limiting our understanding of how species interactions may be responding overall. Using a new global database based on long-term data on the seasonal timing of biological events for pairwise species interactions, we find that the relative timing of interacting species has changed substantially in recent decades. The observed shifts are greater in magnitude than before recent climate change began, suggesting that there will be widespread warming-related shifts in the synchrony of species in the future. Phenological responses to climate change (e.g., earlier leaf-out or egg hatch date) are now well documented and clearly linked to rising temperatures in recent decades. Such shifts in the phenologies of interacting species may lead to shifts in their synchrony, with cascading community and ecosystem consequences. To date, single-system studies have provided no clear picture, either finding synchrony shifts may be extremely prevalent [Mayor SJ, et al. (2017) Sci Rep 7:1902] or relatively uncommon [Iler AM, et al. (2013) Glob Chang Biol 19:2348--2359], suggesting that shifts toward asynchrony may be infrequent. A meta-analytic approach would provide insights into global trends and how they are linked to climate change. We compared phenological shifts among pairwise species interactions (e.g., predator--prey) using published long-term time-series data of phenological events from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across four continents since 1951 to determine whether recent climate change has led to overall shifts in synchrony. We show that the relative timing of key life cycle events of interacting species has changed significantly over the past 35 years. Further, by comparing the period before major climate change (pre-1980s) and after, we show that estimated changes in phenology and synchrony are greater in recent decades. However, there has been no consistent trend in the direction of these changes. Our findings show that there have been shifts in the timing of interacting species in recent decades; the next challenges are to improve our ability to predict the direction of change and understand the full consequences for communities and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Differences in phenological responses to climate change among species can desynchronise ecological interactions and thereby threaten ecosystem function. To assess these threats, we must quantify the relative impact of climate change on species at different trophic levels. Here, we apply a Climate Sensitivity Profile approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets, spatially matched to temperature and precipitation data, to quantify variation in climate sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite this variability, we detected systematic variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological climate sensitivity. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower climate sensitivity than other groups. We used mid-century climate change projections to estimate that the timing of phenological events could change more for primary consumers than for species in other trophic levels (6.2 versus 2.5--2.9 days earlier on average), with substantial taxonomic variation (1.1--14.8 days earlier on average).},

@article{Cohen2018,
	abstract = {Shifts in phenology are already resulting in disruptions to the timing of migration and breeding, and asynchronies between interacting species1--5. Recent syntheses have concluded that trophic level 1 , latitude 6 and how phenological responses are measured 7 are key to determining the strength of phenological responses to climate change. However, researchers still lack a comprehensive framework that can predict responses to climate change globally and across diverse taxa. Here, we synthesize hundreds of published time series of animal phenology from across the planet to show that temperature primarily drives phenological responses at mid-latitudes, with precipitation becoming important at lower latitudes, probably reflecting factors that drive seasonality in each region. Phylogeny and body size are associated with the strength of phenological shifts, suggesting emerging asynchronies between interacting species that differ in body size, such as hosts and parasites and predators and prey. Finally, although there are many compelling biological explanations for spring phenological delays, some examples of delays are associated with short annual records that are prone to sampling error. Our findings arm biologists with predictions concerning which climatic variables and organismal traits drive phenological shifts.},

	abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

	abstract = {Biologishe Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemical Industry (BBCH) scales are a system for the uniform coding of phenologically similar growth stages of plants, using a two-digit decimal code. Currently, scales exist for a number of tree and woody species grown as crops; however, researchers are often forced to adapt existing scales or create their own when describing other tree or woody species growing as crops or weeds. This paper describes a general BBCH scale for the phenological growth stages of tree and woody species, including plant-specific descriptions and decimal codes covering vegetative and reproductive stages. The scale uses eight of the 10 principal BBCH stages, starting with sprouting/bud development (stage 0) and ending with dormancy (stage 9). This BBCH scale represents a single, standardised growth stage key for describing the growth of needle-bearing and leaf-bearing woody plants and promotes the adoption of the use of BBCH scales more widely. It is expected that the scale will form the basis for the creation of further scales specific for family, genus or species. {\textcopyright} 2007 Association of Applied Biologists.},

Many studies have emphasised the action of chilling temperatures in breaking dormancy. However, the effect of the preceding summer temperatures has rarely been investigated although there is some evidence that they may be involved in the settlement and intensity of dormancy as well as cold acclimation. In this paper, thermal time to budburst in relation to the duration of chilling outdoors, preceding summer temperatures and forcing temperatures was studied by outdoors experiments in seedlings of Platanus acerifolia, Vitis vinifera, Quercus pubescens and Castanea sativa. Results showed that temperatures of the preceding summer had no significant effect on the timing of budburst, P. acerifolia and Q. pubescens showed a very weak response to the duration of chilling, and the phenological characteristics of each species were found to be adapted to the climate conditions of its own geographical area. The phenological model used in this study explained 82-100{\%} of the variance of the data without taking into account summer temperatures. Thus, although summer temperatures may be well involved in the intensity of dormancy and cold hardiness, they do not significantly affect budburst and therefore may not need to be considered in phenological models for predicting budburst.},

@article{Laughlin2010,
	abstract = {Summary: 1. Westoby's [. Plant and Soil (1998), 199, 213] Leaf-Height-Seed (LHS) plant strategy scheme quantifies the strategy of a plant based on its location in a three-dimensional space defined by three functional traits: specific leaf area (SLA), height, and seed mass. This scheme is based on aboveground traits and may neglect strategies of belowground resource capture if root functioning is not mirrored in any of the axes. How then do fine roots fit into the LHS scheme?2. We measured 10 functional traits on 133 plant species in a ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona, USA. This data set was used to evaluate how well the LHS scheme accounts for the variation in above and belowground traits. 3. The three most important plant strategies were composed of multiple correlated traits, but SLA, seed mass, and height loaded on separate principle components. The first axis reflected the widely observed 'leaf economics spectrum'. Species at the high end of this spectrum had high SLA, high leaf and fine root nitrogen (N) concentration, and low leaf dry matter content. The second axis reflected variation in seed mass and fine root morphology. Plants at the positive end of this spectrum were plants with large seeds and low specific root length (SRL). The third axis reflected variation in height and phenology. Plants at the positive end of this spectrum were tall species that flower late in the growing season. 4. Leaf N concentration was positively correlated with fine root N concentration. SRL was weakly positively correlated with SLA. SRL was not correlated with fine root N concentration. Leaf litter decomposition rate was positively correlated with the leaf economics spectrum and was negatively correlated with the height and phenology spectrum. 5. Leaf traits, seed mass, and height appear to be integrating properties of species that reflect much of the variation in plant function, including root function. Fine root N concentration was positively mirrored by the leaf economics spectrum, and SRL was inversely mirrored by seed mass. The leaf and height axes play a role in controlling leaf litter decomposability, indicating that these strategy axes have important consequences for ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Sun2006,
	abstract = {To determine the effect of leaf traits on leaf emergence phenology, timing of leaf emergence, leaf expansion rate, durations of leaf emergence and expansion, leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf size were investigated for 48 woody species from 25 families in two closed Chinese white oak (Quercus fabri) forests of eastern China. Cross-species regression and phylogenetic regression were employed to examine the relationship between leaf phenology and leaf traits. Leaf area, LMA, and leaf expansion rate were found to be significantly greater in canopy trees than in understory shrubs in the oak forests. However, there was no significant difference in timing of leaf emergence and durations of leaf emergence and expansion between canopy and understory species. The large-LMA species leafed out earlier than the species with small LMA. The small-leaved species leafed out earlier than the species with large leaves, but the large-leaved species were greater in leaf expansion rate than their counterparts. Leaf expansion rate was positively correlated with leaf area and timing of leaf emergence, but no significant relationship was found between leaf size and leaf expansion period. These results suggest that large- and small-leaved species possibly employed different strategies to minimize herbivory damage, i.e. early leafing to avoid defoliator damage in small-leaved species and fast expanding and thereby shortening vulnerable time to herbivores in large-leaved species. It could be inferred that the species with small leaves and large-LMA leafed out early in the oak forests, thereby permitting less energy loss than their counterparts under the influence of frost in early spring. In general, early leaf emergence is of significance for high LMA species to increase carbon gain in temperate broad-leaved forests, but it is not related to plant height. Leaf size and leaf expansion period are not necessarily correlated. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

First, they control ecosystem processes and define habitat and resources for other taxa; thus, they are a high priority for understanding the ecosystem at a site. Second, knowledge of trait costs and benefits offers the most promising path to understanding how vegetation properties change along physical geography gradients. There exists an informal shortlist of plant traits that are thought to be most informative. Here, we summarize recent research on correlations and tradeoffs surrounding some traits that are prospects for the shortlist. By extending the list and by developing better models for how traits influence species distributions and interactions, a strong foundation of basic ecology can be established, with many practical applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The acquisitive-conservative axis of plant ecological strategies results in a pattern of leaf trait covariation that captures the balance between leaf construction costs and plant growth potential. Studies evaluating trait covariation within species are scarcer, and have mostly dealt with variation in response to environmental gradients. Little work has been published on intraspecific patterns of leaf trait covariation in the absence of strong environmental variation.We analysed covariation of four leaf functional traits (SLA: specific leaf area, LDMC: leaf dry matter content, Ft: force to tear, and Nm: leaf nitrogen content) in six Poaceae and four Fabaceae species common in the dry Chaco forest of Central Argentina, growing in the field and in a common garden. We compared intraspecific covariation patterns (slopes, correlation and effect size) of leaf functional traits with global interspecific covariation patterns. Additionally, we checked for possible climatic and edaphic factors that could affect the intraspecific covariation pattern.We found negative correlations for the LDMC-SLA, Ft-SLA, LDMC-Nm, and Ft-Nm trait pairs. This intraspecific covariation pattern found both in the field and in the common garden and not be explained by climatic or edaphic variation in the field follows the expected acquisitive-conservative axis. At the same time, we found quantitative differences in slopes among different species, and between these intraspecific patterns and the interspecific ones. Many of these differences seem to be idiosyncratic, but some appear consistent among species (e.g.all the intraspecific LDMC-SLA and LDMC-Nm slopes tend to be shallower than the global).Our study indicates that the acquisitive-conservative leaf functional trait covariation pattern occurs at the intraspecific level even in the absence of relevant environmental variation in the field. This suggests a high degree of variation-covariation in leaf functional traits not driven by environmental variables.},

@article{Laube2014,
	abstract = {It is well known that increased spring temperatures cause earlier onset dates of leaf unfolding and flowering. However, a temperature increase in winter may be associated with delayed development when species' chilling requirements are not fulfilled. Furthermore, photosensitivity is supposed to interfere with temperature triggers. To date, neither the relative importance nor possible interactions of these three factors have been elucidated. In this study, we present a multispecies climate chamber experiment to test the effects of chilling and photoperiod on the spring phenology of 36 woody species. Several hypotheses regarding their variation with species traits (successional strategy, floristic status, climate of their native range) were tested. Long photoperiods advanced budburst for one-third of the studied species, but magnitudes of these effects were generally minor. In contrast to prior hypotheses, photosensitive responses were not restricted to climax or oceanic species. Increased chilling length advanced budburst for almost all species; its effect greatly exceeding that of photoperiod. Moreover, we suggest that photosensitivity and chilling effects have to be rigorously disentangled, as the response to photoperiod was restricted to individuals that had not been fully chilled. The results indicate that temperature requirements and successional strategy are linked, with climax species having higher chilling and forcing requirements than pioneer species. Temperature requirements of invasive species closely matched those of native species, suggesting that high phenological concordance is a prerequisite for successful establishment. Lack of chilling not only led to a considerable delay in budburst but also caused substantial changes in the chronological order of species' budburst. The results reveal that increased winter temperatures might impact forest ecosystems more than formerly assumed. Species with lower chilling requirements, such as pioneer or invasive species, might profit from warming winters, if late spring frost events would in parallel occur earlier. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

@article{Perez-Harguindeguy2013,
	abstract = {In this paper, we have reviewed how the hydraulic design of trees influences the movement of water from roots to leaves. The hydraulic architecture of trees can limit their water relations, gas exchange throughout the crown of trees, the distribution of trees over different habitats and, perhaps, even the maximum height that a particular species can achieve. Parameters of particular importance include: (1) the vulnerability of stems to drought-induced cavitation events because cavitation reduces the hydraulic conductance of stems, (2) the leaf specific conductivity of stems because it determines the pressure gradients and most negative water potentials needed to sustain evaporation from leaves, (3) the water storage capacity of tissues because this might determine the ability of trees to survive long drought periods. All of these parameters are determined by the structure and function of anatomical components of trees. Some of the ecological and physiological trade-offs of specific structures are discussed.},

@article{Violle2012,
	abstract = {Despite being recognized as a promoter of diversity and a condition for local coexistence decades ago, the importance of intraspecific variance has been neglected over time in community ecology. Recently, there has been a new emphasis on intraspecific variability. Indeed, recent developments in trait-based community ecology have underlined the need to integrate variation at both the intraspecific as well as interspecific level. We introduce new T-statistics ('T' for trait), based on the comparison of intraspecific and interspecific variances of functional traits across organizational levels, to operationally incorporate intraspecific variability into community ecology theory. We show that a focus on the distribution of traits at local and regional scales combined with original analytical tools can provide unique insights into the primary forces structuring communities. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {A well-timed phenology is essential for plant growth and reproduction, but species-specific phenological strategies are still poorly understood. Here, we use a common garden approach to compare biannual leaf-out data for 495 woody species growing outdoors in Munich, 90{\%} of them not native to that climate regime. For three species, data were augmented by herbarium dates for 140-year-long time series. We further meta-analysed 107 temperate-zone woody species in which leaf-out cues have been studied, half of them also monitored here. Southern climate-adapted species flushed significantly later than natives, and photoperiod- and chilling- sensitive species all flushed late. The herbarium method revealed the extent of species-specific climate tracking. Our results forecast that: (1) a northward expansion of southern species due to climate warming will increase the number of late flushers in the north, counteracting documented and expected flushing time advances; and (2) photoperiod- and chilling-sensitive woody species cannot rapidly track climate warming.},
