\section*{Research questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Do phenological cue-trait relationships change across transects? Populations?
\item How do budburst cues relate to functional traits in temperate woody species?
\item How do shrub and tree species differ in their cue-trait relationships?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Materials and Methods}
\subsection*{Field sampling}

\begin{enumerate}
\item General pop description
\begin{enumerate}
\item Combined \emph{in situ} trait data with budburst data from two growth chamber cutting experiments
\item Traits were measured across four eastern populations --- Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA (42.55$^{\circ}$N, 72.20$^{\circ}$W) and St. Hippolyte, Quebec, Canada (45.98$^{\circ}$N, 74.01$^{\circ}$W) and four western population --- Smithers (54.78$^{\circ}$N, 127.17$^{\circ}$W) and E.C. Manning Park (49.06$^{\circ}$N, 120.78$^{\circ}$W)
\item Growth chamber study --- cuttings collected from the most southern and northern populations in each transect
\item Both datasets span latitudinal gradient of 4-6$^{\circ}$
\end{enumerate}

\item Describing spp
\begin{enumerate}
\item Across populations --- measured \Sexpr{nSpp} species --- \Sexpr{nSppE} eastern transect and \Sexpr{nSppW} western transect
\item Selected spp that were most abundant in forest communities
\item Eastern transect: \Sexpr{nSppES} shrubs and \Sexpr{nSppET} trees
\item Western transect: \Sexpr{nSppWS} shrubs and \Sexpr{nSppWT} trees
\item Three species occurred in both transect
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Functional traits}

\begin{enumerate}
\item General sampling info
\begin{enumerate}
\item Traits were measured in the summer prior to each growth chamber study.
\item Eastern transect: traits measured summer 2015 
\item Western transect: traits measured May 29 to July 30, 2019
\item For each --- measured traits for X-10 healthy, adult, individuals of each species
\end{enumerate}

\item Trait sampling --- structural/wood traits
\begin{enumerate}
\item Measured a total of five traits: height (n = \Sexpr{nHt}), DBH (n = \Sexpr{nDBH}), SSD (n = \Sexpr{nSSD}), LMA (n = \Sexpr{nLMA}), LNC (n = \Sexpr{nLNC})
\item Traits were measured according to recommendations of Perez-Harguindeguy2013.
\item Height was measured using a range finder (XX brand etc.).
\item Diameter at breast height was measured 1.42 m from the ground.
\item Wood volume was measured within 12 hours of collection --- 10 cm sample taken from tree branches or shrub primary stems --- measured using the water displacement method
\item Branch segments were dried at 105$^{\circ}$C for 24h and weighted.
\end{enumerate}

\item Trait sampling --- leaf traits
\begin{enumerate}
\item Leaf traits were measured for five haphazardly selected, fully expanded, and hardened leaves 
\item High resolution scans of leaf area taken using Canon flatbed scanner within 12 hours of collection
\item Leaf area was then quantified using the ImageJ software
\item Leaves were dried for 48h at 70$^{\circ}$C and weighed using a precision balance.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Growth chamber study}
\begin{enumerate}
\item General information
\begin{enumerate}
\item To collect branch cuttings for growth chamber study --- returned to our highest and lowest latitude populations in each transect
\item Eastern transect: Hippolyte and Harvard Forested visited again in 20-28 January for growth chamber study --- study conducted at Arnold Arboretum
\item Western transect: traits measured May 29 to July 30, 2019 --- Smithers and Manning park visited again in 19-28 October, 2019 --- study conducted at UBC
\end{enumerate}

\item Treatments and duration
\begin{enumerate}
\item For both growth chamber studies --- 8 distinct treatments:
\item two levels of chilling --- no additional chilling or 30 days at 4$^{\circ}$C = eastern study, and 30 days or 70 days of chilling at 4$^{\circ}$C for our western study --- all dark
\item two levels of forcingâ€”a cool regime of 15:5$^{\circ}$C and a warm regime of 20:10$^{\circ}$C
\item two photoperiods of either 8 or 12 hours
\item For detailed disucssion of study differences see Loughnan et al. (phenology paper)
\end{enumerate}

\item Data collection --- BBCH
\begin{enumerate}
\item Phenological stages were based on BBCH scale adapted for our specific species
\item Observations made every 1-3 days for each sample
\item stages were recorded up to full leaf expansion --- limited our analysis to budburst 
\item Eastern study lasted for 82 days, 19320 observations---add Sexpr obj
\item Western study lasted for 113 days, 47844 observations
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Statistical Anlaysis}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduce approach and why it is useful:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Our analysis combined the trait data with the budburst data from the growth chamber study
\item Built joint model for each trait---directly models the relationship between leaf and structural traits and budburst 
\item Approach carries through uncertainty between trait and phenology data---combines observational trait data with experimental phenology data
\end{enumerate}

\item Begin to describe the model:
\begin{enumerate}
\item hierarchical linear model---partitioning variation of individual observations (\emph{i}) of a given trait value ($y_{\text{trait}[i]}$) to the effects of species (\emph{sp id}), and population-level differences arising from transects (\emph{transect id}) or the interaction between transects and latitude (\emph{transect} $\times$ \emph{latitude}), and residual variation ($\sigma_{\text{trait}}$), sometimes called `measurement error').
\item Transect included as a dummy variable and latitude as a continuous variable 
\item Latitude values z-scored 
\item Most traits were modeled using their natural units---except LMA was rescaled by 100
\end{enumerate}

\item describe trait part of model
\begin{enumerate}
\item Model give unique estimates for each species ($\alpha_{\text{sp[sp id]}}$) and estimate of variance---partial pooling---controls for variation in the number of trait estimates per spp and trait variability 
\item Estimate for differences between transect ($\beta_{transect}$) and the interaction between transects and latitude ($\beta_{transect \times latitude}$) 
\item These species-level estimates of traits become predictors of species-level estimates of each cue--- ($\beta_{\text{force[sp]}}$, $\beta_{\text{chill[sp]}}$, $\beta_{\text{photo[sp]}}$) 
\end{enumerate}

Trait model:
\begin{align}
\mu_{trait} & = \alpha_{\text{grand trait}} + \alpha_{\text{sp[sp id]}} + \beta_{\text{transect}} +\beta_{\text{transect} \times \text{latitude}} \\
\beta_{transect} &  \sim normal( \mu_{transect}, \sigma_{\text{transect}}) \nonumber \\
\beta_{\text{transect} \times \text{latitude}} &  \sim normal( \mu_{\text{transect} \times \text{latitude}}, \sigma_{\text{transect} \times \text{latitude}}) \nonumber 
\end{align}

Cue part:
\begin{align}
\beta_{\text{chill[sp]}} & = \alpha_{\text{chill}[sp]} + \beta_{\text{trait}.\text{chill}} \times \alpha_{\text{trait sp[sp]}} \nonumber \\
\beta_{\text{force[sp]}} & = \alpha_{\text{force}[sp]} + \beta_{\text{trait}.\text{force}} \times \alpha_{\text{trait sp[sp]}} \\
\beta_{\text{photo[sp]}} & = \alpha_{\text{photo}[sp]} + \beta_{\text{trait}.\text{photo}} \times \alpha_{\text{trait sp[sp]}} \nonumber 
\end{align}

\item Explain phenology part of model
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Across each spp---get esti of overall effect of each trait on cue ($\beta_{\text{trait}.\text{chill}}$, $\beta_{\text{trait}.\text{force}}$, $\beta_{\text{trait}.\text{photo}}$)
\item and estimate of species-level cue variation not explained by traits ($\alpha_{\text{chill}[sp]} $, $\alpha_{\text{force}[sp]}$, $\alpha_{\text{photo}[sp]}$) = estimate of how well trait effects explain species-level differences
\item Also get estimates of species responses to cues ($C_i$, $F_i$, $P_i$, respectively---z-scored)---with residual variation across species ($\alpha_{\text{pheno[sp]}}$) and observations ($\sigma_{\text{pheno}}$)
\item Partial pooling for residual variation across species and variation in cues not attributed to the trait
\end{enumerate}

\begin{align}
\mu_{pheno} & = \alpha_{\text{pheno[sp]}}+ \beta_{\text{chill[sp]}} \times C_i + \beta_{\text{force[sp]}}\times F_i + \beta_{\text{photo[sp]}} \times P_i\\
y_{\text{pheno[i]}} & \sim normal( \mu_{pheno}, \sigma_{\text{pheno}}) \nonumber 
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\alpha_{\text{pheno}} \sim normal(\mu_{\alpha_{\text{pheno}}},\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{pheno}}}) \\
\alpha_{\text{force}} \sim normal(\mu_{\alpha_{\text{force}}},\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{force}}}) \nonumber \\
\alpha_{\text{chill}} \sim normal(\mu_{\alpha_{\text{chill}}},\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{chill}}}) \nonumber \\
\alpha_{\text{photo}} \sim normal(\mu_{\alpha_{\text{photo}}},\sigma_{\alpha_{\text{photo}}}) \nonumber
\end{align}

\item General info about model checks etc.:
\begin{enumerate}
\item weakly informative priors
\item validated model priors using prior predictive checks
\item model was coded in the Stan programming language and fit using the rstan package cite rstan2018
\item Four chains (4000-6000 total sampling iterations), and all models met basic diagnostic checks, including no divergences, high effective sample size (\emph{$n_{eff}$}), and $\hat{R}$ close to 1---LMA model still has low ESS---issue with neff---otherwise this is true
\item 90\% UI given in text

\end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate} 

\section*{Results}

\begin{enumerate}
%brief summary of what we did
\item Our study = one of the first to combine trait data with phenological cue responses for the same individuals and across species distributions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Includes plant communities in eastern and western deciduous forests of North America
\item Samples collected from multiple populations---modelling approach that accounts for variation across populations and transects
\item Joint modelling approach = use sp-level estimates for traits to understand phenological cue responses and budburst timing
\item Taking a community-level approach---with woody tree and shrub species = different growth strategies and presumably suites of traits
\end{enumerate}

% 1. Do phenological cue-trait relationships change across transects? Populations?
\item Traits differed in their population-level variation
% Ht:  population effect (-ve) but latxtran effect crosses zero (95% UI)
% LMA:  strong latxtran interaction and pop effect both +ve
% DBH: population effect (-ve) but -ve latxtran effect  (95% UI crosses zero)
% SSD: no population and latxtran effect (95% UI crosses zero)
% LNC strong latxtran interaction
\begin{enumerate}
\item Most of our traits varied across populations---changing both between the two transects and with latitude
\item Height (\Sexpr{htLatTran}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_htLatTran},\Sexpr{upper_htLatTran}), DBH (\Sexpr{dbhLatTran}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_dbhLatTran},\Sexpr{upper_dbhLatTran}), and LMA (\Sexpr{lmaLatTran}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_lmaLatTran},\Sexpr{upper_lmaLatTran})---strong interactions between latitude and transect
\item We found tree height to decline with increasing latitude, while tree DBH and LMA both increased
\item LNC differed between the two transects (\Sexpr{lncLatTran}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_lncLatTran},\Sexpr{upper_lncLatTran}---greater in western transect
\item But no population-level variation in SSD
\item Fig. \ref{fig:tranInt}
\end{enumerate}
%2. What other functional traits relate to budburst phenology in temperate woody species?
% Multiple paragraphs --- discuss ht and DBH and SSD and then leaf traits
\item All traits related to at least one budburst cue---but responses were generally weak
\begin{enumerate}
\item Of our three cues---photoperiod strongest relationship with other traits
\item Our two structural traits = similar cue relationships---taller plants with greater DBH = stronger photoperiod responses = earlier bb under longer daylengths (\Sexpr{htMuPSpMean}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_htMuPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_htMuPSpMean} for height and (\Sexpr{dbhBPSpMean}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_dbhBPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_dbhMuPSpMean} for DBH) 
\item But no correlation between between ring porosity of wood with cues \ref{fig:ringPorosity}.
\end{enumerate}

\item leaf traits varied more in the direction of cue responses 
\begin{enumerate}
\item LMA showed strong responses to photoperiod with low LMA species advancing in bb with longer photoperiods (\Sexpr{lmaMuPSpMean}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_lmaBPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lmaBPSpMean})
\item In contrast---LNC strong responses to forcing but not chilling or photoperiod---high LNC species responded more to warmer spring temperatures (\Sexpr{lncBFSpMean}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_lncBFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lncBFSpMean})
\end{enumerate}

\item Regardless of trait effects---our joint modeling approach still estimated phenological cue responses in line with previous work. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item All models showed earlier budburst in response to all three cues
\item Individual spp varied in both their timing and cue responses---but for most models responses were strongest for chilling and weakest for photoperiod.
\item Only our LMA produced unique cue estimates---estimating photoperiod cues (\Sexpr{lmaMuPSpMean}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_lmaMuPSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lmaMuPSpMean}) stronger than forcing cues (\Sexpr{lmaMuFSpMean}, UI: \Sexpr{lower_lmaMuFSpMean}, \Sexpr{upper_lmaMuFSpMean}) (Table \ref{tabLMA})
\item ref Fig. \ref{fig:muCuePlot} and Fig. \ref{fig:muCueTraitPlot}
\end{enumerate}

% How do shrub and tree species differ in their cue-trait relationships?
\item Including trait effects better informed spp level estimates of phenology
\begin{enumerate}
\item Estimates bb using our model parameters show clear differences in bb timing between tree and shrub spp for some traits (Fig. \ref{fig:bbShrubTree})
\item Height showed strong correlations between bb timing and trait values---shrub spp were estimated to bb earlier---especially under stronger cues---tree spp were later
\item But this was not case for leaf traits---LNC showed no distinct separation between species functional groups (Fig. \ref{fig:bbShrubTree})
%\item But species-level effects vary across traits = unique effects on cue responses---estimated order of spp bb order differs between the two models
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
