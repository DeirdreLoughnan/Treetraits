%Title ideas:
% old title: Phenological cue use varies with functional traits in North American woody plant communities
% Cues shaping woody plant temporal niche differs from cues driving species overall trait phenotype 
% ....need more

\title{Photoperiod shows strong relationships with leaf and wood traits but not woody plant budburst} %24Dec2023emw -- I really like the bold title! But it sounds so specific that it would likely limit where you could get the paper into review (... and it took me a lot of re-reading it to understand what you might mean. I am not sure we actually test this latter point, do we?). Maybe: Differences in leaf and wood traits predict phenological sensitivity to daylength more than temperature [Sounds weird, but something to work on -- maybe committee will have ideas.]
